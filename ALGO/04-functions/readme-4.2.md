# rand10() function 

* It's a custom function that generates a random integer between 1 and 10 (inclusive). Here's an explanation of how it works:

* The function rand10() is defined without any parameters.

* Inside the function, Math.random() is used to generate a random decimal number between 0 (inclusive) and 1 (exclusive). This means the generated number will be a decimal greater than or equal to 0 and less than 1.

* The decimal number generated by Math.random() is then multiplied by 10. This transforms the range from 0-1 to 0-10 (exclusive), meaning the result will be a decimal between 0 (inclusive) and 10 (exclusive).

* To convert the decimal value to an integer, Math.floor() is used. This function rounds down the decimal to the nearest whole number. As a result, we get an integer between 0 (inclusive) and 9 (inclusive).

* To obtain a number between 1 and 10 (inclusive) instead of 0 and 9, 1 is added to the result obtained in the previous step.

* Finally, the resulting integer between 1 and 10 is returned as the output of the rand10() function.
Therefore, each time you call the rand10() function, it will generate a random integer between 1 and 10.
