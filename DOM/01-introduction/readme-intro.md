# console.log(document.title); 

* Prints the title of the current HTML document to the browser console.

* document refers to the current HTML document that is loaded in the browser window.

* .title is a property of the document object that represents the title of the HTML document.

* console.log() is a function that outputs the value passed to it to the browser console.

By using console.log(document.title);, the title of the HTML document will be displayed in the console. This can be helpful for debugging purposes or checking the current title of the document during development.

# document.title = "Modifying the DOM";

* Modifies the title of the current HTML document and sets it to "Modifying the DOM".

* document refers to the current HTML document that is loaded in the browser window.

* .title is a property of the document object that represents the title of the HTML document.

* = is the assignment operator used to assign a new value to a variable or property.

By using document.title = "Modifying the DOM";, the title of the HTML document will be changed to "Modifying the DOM". This means that if this code is executed, the browser tab or window will display the new title specified. Modifying the document title dynamically can be useful in various scenarios, such as updating the title based on user actions or dynamically generated content.


# const bodyChildren = document.body.children[1].children;
# for (const child of bodyChildren) {
#    console.log(child);
# }

* This code retrieves the child elements of the second direct child of the body element in the HTML document, and then logs them to the browser console. This can be useful for visualizing the HTML elements present in that specific part of the page and performing additional operations on them if needed.

* const bodyChildren = document.body.children[1].children;

* Here, a variable bodyChildren is declared using the const keyword. It is initialized with the child elements of the second direct child of the body element. The document object represents the current HTML document, document.body represents the body element, and children is a property that returns a collection of child elements of a given node.
for (const child of bodyChildren) {

* A for...of loop is used to iterate over each child element in the bodyChildren collection. The loop will execute the code block inside the curly braces {} for each element.
console.log(child);

* At each iteration of the loop, the child variable will hold one child element of the body. The console.log() function is used to display this element in the browser console. This can help you inspect the properties and values of each element.

# #const randomColor = `rgb(${getRandomNumber()}, ${getRandomNumber()}, ${getRandomNumber()})`;
# document.body.style.backgroundColor = randomColor;

# function getRandomNumber() {
#    return Math.floor(Math.random() * 256);
# }

* Generates a random RGB color value and applies it as the background color of the document.body.

* const randomColor = rgb(${getRandomNumber()}, ${getRandomNumber()}, ${getRandomNumber()});

This line declares a constant variable randomColor using the const keyword. It is assigned a random RGB color value by calling the getRandomNumber() function three times to generate random numbers between 0 and 255 for the red, green, and blue components of the color. The RGB values are interpolated into a string using template literals ( ) and the ${} syntax.

* document.body.style.backgroundColor = randomColor;

This line sets the backgroundColor property of the style object of the document.body to the generated randomColor. It changes the background color of the entire document's body to the random color.

* function getRandomNumber() { return Math.floor(Math.random() * 256); }

This is a function declaration for getRandomNumber(). It generates and returns a random whole number between 0 and 255 using Math.random() and Math.floor() functions. The multiplication by 256 ensures that the range of generated numbers is from 0 to 255.
