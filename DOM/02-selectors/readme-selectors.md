# const elements = document.querySelectorAll('.important');
# elements.forEach(element => {
#    element.setAttribute('title', 'This is an important item');
# });

* const elements = document.querySelectorAll('.important');

This line uses the querySelectorAll() method to select all elements that have the important class. It returns a collection of elements and assigns it to the elements variable.

* elements.forEach(element => { ... });

The forEach() method is used to iterate over each element in the elements collection.

* element.setAttribute('title', 'This is an important item');

Within the loop, the setAttribute() method is used to add a title attribute to each element and set its value to "This is an important item". The first argument is the name of the attribute, and the second argument is the desired value.

By executing this code, each element with the important class will have a title attribute set to "This is an important item". The title attribute provides additional information when the user hovers over the element, usually displayed as a tooltip.

# const images = document.querySelectorAll('img');
# images.forEach(image => {
#    if (!image.classList.contains('important')) {
#        image.style.display = 'none';
#    }
# });

* const images = document.querySelectorAll('img');

This line uses the querySelectorAll() method to select all <img> tags in the document. It returns a collection of image elements and assigns it to the images variable.

* images.forEach(image => { ... });

The forEach() method is used to iterate over each image element in the images collection.

* if (!image.classList.contains('important')) { ... }

Within the loop, an if statement checks if the current image element does not have the important class. The classList.contains() method is used to determine if the class is present or not.

* image.style.display = 'none';

If the image element does not have the important class, its display property is set to 'none'. This will hide the image by making it not visible on the page.

By executing this code, all <img> tags will be looped through, and if they don't have the important class, their display property will be set to "none", effectively hiding them from view on the page.

# const paragraphs = document.querySelectorAll('p');
# paragraphs.forEach(paragraph => {
#   console.log(paragraph.textContent);
#   if (paragraph.classList.lenght > 0) {
#       console.log(paragraph.classList);
#   }
# })

* const paragraphs = document.querySelectorAll('p');

This line uses the querySelectorAll() method to select all <p> tags in the document. It returns a collection of paragraph elements and assigns it to the paragraphs variable.

* paragraphs.forEach(paragraph => { ... });

The forEach() method is used to iterate over each paragraph element in the paragraphs collection.

* console.log(paragraph.textContent);

Within the loop, console.log() is used to display the content of each paragraph in the console. The textContent property retrieves the text content of the paragraph element.

* if (paragraph.classList.length > 0) { ... }

An if statement checks if the current paragraph element has any classes. The classList.length property is used to determine if the paragraph has any classes. If it has at least one class, the code block inside the if statement will be executed.

* console.log(paragraph.classList);

If the paragraph has a class (i.e., the if condition is true), its class name(s) will be displayed in the console using console.log(). The classList property is used to retrieve the class name(s) of the paragraph element.

By executing this code, all <p> tags will be looped through, and their content will be displayed in the console. If a paragraph has a class, its classname(s) will also be displayed. This allows you to see the content of each paragraph and check if any classes are applied to them.

# const para = document.querySelectorAll('p');
# para.forEach(paragraph => {
#   if (!paragraph.classList.lenght) {
#       const randomColor = getRandomColor();
#       paragraph.style.color = randomColor;
#   }
# });

# function getRandomColor() {
#   const letters = '0123456789ABCDEF';
#   let color = '#';
#   for (let i = 0; i < 6; i++) {
#       color += letters[Math.floor(Math.random() * 16)];
#    }
#    return color;
# }

* const para = document.querySelectorAll('p');

This line uses the querySelectorAll() method to select all <p> tags in the document. It returns a collection of paragraph elements and assigns it to the para variable.

* para.forEach(paragraph => { ... });

The forEach() method is used to iterate over each paragraph element in the para collection.

* if (!paragraph.classList.lenght) { ... }

An if statement checks if the current paragraph element does not have any classes. The classList.length property is used to determine if the paragraph has any classes. If it doesn't have any classes (length is 0), the code block inside the if statement will be executed.

* const randomColor = getRandomColor();

Within the if block, a random color is generated by calling the getRandomColor() function, and the color value is assigned to the randomColor variable.

* paragraph.style.color = randomColor;

* The style.color property is used to set the text color of the paragraph to the randomly generated color.

* The getRandomColor() function generates a random hexadecimal color code. It iterates six times to generate a random color in the format #RRGGBB, where RR, GG, and BB represent hexadecimal values for red, green, and blue respectively. This function ensures a unique random color for each paragraph.

By executing this code, each <p> tag will be checked. If a paragraph doesn't have any classes, it will be assigned a random text color. Paragraphs that already have classes will be left as they are, preserving their existing styles.
